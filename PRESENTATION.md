## Introduction 

Since files are essentially just a series of bits, we can represent files in Minecraft as a series of blocks. 

At the simplest form, we can use two different blocks, one to represent the value `0`, and the other to represent the value `1`. 

The number `25` in binary is `0001 1001`. If black wool = 0 and white wool = 1, it would like like this in Minecraft: 



To save a little bit of space, I decided to use 16 different blocks (16 different colors of wool), with each block representing 4 bits. This means that a block could hold 16 different possible values (0-15), and every pair of blocks could hold 16 * 16 = 256 different possible values (0-255).
